========

**[Not-For-Production](https://github.com/hashiprobr/nfp) Expo template based on
React Navigation, React Native Paper, and additional components and hooks.**

If your project is a class assignment or a simple prototype, use this template
to have React Navigation and React Native Paper support with minimum
boilerplate, as well as components and hooks specifically designed for
simplifying the usage of popular features. The dependency versions were
carefully chosen to avoid runtime errors and warnings.
